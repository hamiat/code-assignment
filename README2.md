Tasks in order of priority:

1. (REQUIRED) When instantiating the class with the imported movies.json file, add an “id” and a random “rating” from 1 to 5 for each movie before storing it.

2. A method that returns the movies sorted by name.
3. A method that returns movies from a certain genre.

4. A method that prints out movies sorted from bottom rated to top rated.
5. A method that prints out the three top rated movies.
6. A method that returns the 2 top rated movies and 2 bottom rated movies.

7. A method that returns the movies with the subtitle and thumb properties filtered out.

8. A method that returns a movie with a certain id (if found).
9. A method that removes a movie with a certain id (if found).
10. A method that changes the title of a movie with a certain id (if found). The updated title should be sent in as an argument to the method.

11. A method that allows the user to add a new movie object to the movie list (supply all properties but the “id” and “rating”. The “id” and “rating” properties should be added internally by the method.

The approach taken was to divide the different tasks into groups in according to relating array methods.
